# People

> You work for your team, they work for the product. People are all that
> matters.

People solve problems, build software, and take decisions. Yet, many leaders
focus on how the code works, which tools to use, and which decisions to make for
their teams.

This leadership style doesn't work: it frustrates the people _doing_ the job,
they always have more context about the tiny details than their leaders. This
style doesn't scale either: there are too many decisions to make, too many
features to build, too many technologies to try.

You need to leverage the collective intelligence of your teams which is why we
build teams in the first place. You need to focus on what matters to build
awesome products: the people building them.

Being a leader means you _don't_ do any of the work your teams are responsible
for. If you want to _do_ any of those things, then you have the wrong job. Your job
is to work _for them_, so they can unlock their full potential.

The natural starting point of building a healthy team is a healthy hiring
pipeline. Hiring is often built on the wrong assumptions, so we have to
talk about those assumptions and how to get rid of them in the first place before
we can dive into hiring.

## Diversity is key

I've always been hesitant to write about diversity. I'm a white cishet man
living in the European capital of startups: I'm the definition of privilege.
And yet I can't imagine writing a book about leading developers that ignores
diversity.

When I find a problem hard to grasp, I sometimes think about it in terms of
opposites: it's a technique that helps me define the main characteristics of
the problem at hand. Understanding why our industry has such a broken hiring
process and scores so badly at diversity was one of these hard problems for me.
So let me try to break it down for you the way I understood it.

The opposite of a diverse team is a team of people with the same background,
speaking the same native language. The most tragicomically common version of it
being a team of "X white males aged 25 to 30". Monoculture teams are far too
common in our industry. I talked to many people leading such teams and their
thinking showed clear signs of misleading assumptions. I'm going to examine the
assumptions that occur most often. Let's start with a question that we all know
the answer to so well it may feel rhetorical:

> Why do we build teams?

The answer is obvious: we want more. We want to build more features, we want to
write more docs, we want to fix more bugs. We always want more.

The assumption is that more people get more things done. We also expect bigger
teams to maintain or even increase the quality of the output. At the same time, we
know that teams come with overheads of communication and synchronisation. So
what offsets the increased costs? The underlying assumption is that we believe
in collective intelligence.

We believe a team of people is smarter than just one person. When we say "we
need a bigger team" what we really mean is "we need a smarter team". The problem
is that increasing the headcount doesn't equate to a smarter team. Monoculture
teams of "white male kids reading Hacker News in their free time" produce poorer
results than diverse teams.

> A smarter team _is_ a diverse team.

Monoculture teams can't be as smart as diverse teams.

Then why is there so little diversity in the industry? I fail to come up with an
answer that doesn't imply that we, as an industry, aren't as smart as we think
we are.

If we want more of everything, then we want smarter teams. We want to increase
our collective intelligence. So there is no better strategy than striving for
diversity: it dramatically increases your chances of getting a smarter team.

Diversity isn't great because it's cool. Diversity is great because only
diverse teams have a chance to be great at design. If increasing diversity is
not your answer to building teams, then you are wasting time and money. It's
cheaper and faster to hire freelancers.

Another misleading assumption I often run into is cultural fit. Most people hire
or fire based on the belief that cultural fit means team members must be alike
and think alike. That isn't cultural fit though, that's cultural homogeneity.

You don't need people to be alike, you need them to fit in with each other. It
is ironic how we transform the meaning of cultural fit into something much
closer to its opposite, while the name makes it clear: cultural fit is about
fitting together.

Think about it the way you'd think about putting a band together. You don't need
4 guitarists and no drummer. But you also don't need to hire all jazz players.
In fact, a band works great when they have a common musical goal and all their
members have different musical backgrounds.

Perhaps the most complicated assumption is that diversity is just about gender.
I'm not sure why this is so, I guess it's because one of our industry specialties
is making our spaces hostile to women. Most companies have an awful gender
distribution and they think it's good enough to reach a two-digit percentage of
women in their teams. That isn't nearly enough, and thinking only about the
gender distribution isn't enough either. We have to get rid of this assumption.
It's hard to do because the problem is hidden well behind the gender issue, which
is also complex enough on its own. But you can't ignore that there are more
dimensions to this problem than just the gender. There is age, technical seniority, country of
origin, religion or lack of it, sexual orientation, personality, area of
expertise. I'm sure I'm biased in many ways and I'm missing some dimensions!
The point, though, is that there are many dimensions and they all matter. Each
dimension brings something to your teams: a way of thinking you didn't consider,
a new attitude towards the problems your teams need to solve.

> Diversity is the currency for intelligence.

Every time you increase the diversity of your teams by one or more dimensions,
you are buying intelligence. You are making your team smarter because you are
adding something new you didn't have before. Think of hiring as an addition
exercise: "What would this candidate add to the team?" is a better perspective
than "what can this candidate do for us?".

In one of the companies I worked for, we built a team of 30 people in less than
two years and had almost perfect gender distribution across various disciplines.
We scored pretty well on many other dimensions too. Many people asked me how
we did it. It's simple: you have to care about diversity every single day from
the first day. Simple doesn't mean easy though. The more diverse you want your
teams to be, the more inclusive your processes have to be: job ads, screening,
hiring and firing processes, written and verbal communication. It requires
constant vigilance over your biases and your assumptions. The more people you
work with, the harder it gets to keep the focus for a leader. More people means
more biases and more assumptions too, which is an interesting catch-22 situation.
You have to work with your existing teams every day because you need to stay
diverse. As I said, simple isn't easy.

I want to close this paragraph with a trivial example I use all the time. It's
about a day I'm running an analysis on the bug my teams had worked on in the
past few months. After some crunching, an obvious number stood out. More than 85%
of our frontend bugs happened on Windows browsers. I was puzzled at first but
then something really obvious hit me. My whole organisation used mac laptops.
All our frontend developers used Chrome. We were a monoculture! You know why I
use this story all the time? It's because it happened in the team I just
mentioned. We thought we were a diverse team. Well, we weren't if we had
considered the OS/Browser dimensions!

## Hiring

I don't understand the way our industry approaches hiring: we write job ads
that scare people away, we hire recruiters to do the job for us, we ask
candidates meaningless questions. It's almost like we don't care who we hire
and, maybe, we don't.

Our industry is so obsessed with shipping fast and breaking things that it
forgets that people ship things. We often use a hiring pipeline that makes no sense
because we didn't design it ourselves. We do what everyone else does or what we
were doing before. That's rarely the right approach and, moreover, it can't be
the right approach when it comes to people. You need to know _who_ you want to
hire. Before you start feeding your hiring pipeline with candidates, you and
your team need to agree on who _exactly_ you are looking for. Most companies
build profiles that stop at "Lang X developer" or "Senior whatever". Those are
not people profiles, they represent only the area of expertise and the seniority
of a profile. We hire people though, not their CVs.

I suggest you build a mental model for your hiring needs. You do so by taking
into account many factors and dimensions to identify who to hire next. For the
sake of the conversation, let's consider a bare minimum of dimensions:

- Gender
- Age
- Cultural background
- Technical seniority
- Area of expertise

I'm personally not smart enough to keep all of them in my head for more than
one team, so I _always_ use a mental model while working with multiple teams.
The technique I use to build and visualise this mental model consists of the
following steps:

- Get the names of all your teams on a whiteboard.
- Add a score for each dimension to each team.
- Look for the lowest scores in each team.
- Adjust your hiring strategy accordingly.

I can accept that scoring teams by each dimension is an oversimplification of
reality. Mental models are oversimplifications by definition because [all models
are wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). But they're a
useful starting point. In fact, this simplified approach is already
significantly better than just caring about the technical seniority or the area of
expertise like many companies do. I generally count people in each team by each
dimension and averages for age.

This process scales well because you can apply it to aggregates. It works even if
you have teams of more than a hundred people. The idea is always the same: look for the dimensions in
which you score the worst. Once you know who to hire, you can focus on the
pipeline. I recommend you do this exercise every two or three months, it keeps
the information fresh in your mind and you get a good sense of who to look for.
One interesting side-effect of this approach is that it often leads to the best
kind of hiring: internal hiring. Let me use a trivial example. Imagine you have
a team that really needs a JavaScript expert and then you got another team where
you have two JavaScript experts. Maybe one of them is bored? It would be a win-win
situation for everyone.

Knowing who to hire is the most important step of the hiring process because it
comes _before_ you even start the process. But it's only the first step of a
long journey. As hiring is about people, you need to care about it every day.
Hiring is a process you must design on your own, so let's move on to it.

### Design your pipeline

Hiring is hard but firing is much harder. The best way to avoid firing people
is not to hire them in the first place. You can never get to a 100% success rate
with your hires because time is always a pressing factor. If you can afford the
slowest process possible, then do so. There are too many factors that contribute
to a successful hire, so you have to accept that you may fail from time to time. In
my experience, a good success rate is 90%: nine people out of ten stay with you
for a significant amount of time and both parties are happy about their choice.

The best way to minimise false positives is (surprise!) to strive for diversity.
You involve as many people as possible in your process, you let team members
talk to candidates. It works both for you and the candidates: you find out as
much as you can about them and they find out as much about you. Tell the
candidates everything you find relevant about your company and ask them what you
missed. I often got the feedback that my interview process was better than
average because candidates were getting much more information about us than from
other companies they were talking to. That's a competitive advantage, and it
sends the message that you care. It's easy to give people the wrong impression
about yourself, in the end we never manage to dedicate enough time to candidates
and they're probably talking to many companies at the same time. Letting them
talk to more people on the team helps you avoid misunderstandings. In aggregate,
you and your team should give them the _right_ impression.

You need to be empathic if you want to design a good hiring process. Look at
your hiring pipeline from the perspective of the candidate. Create a delicate
balance between the experience of the candidates and your need for information
about them. For the sake of this discussion, here is a high level breakdown of
the hiring process:

- Put an ad on job boards.
- Screen the candidates.
- Interview them.
- Hire them or reject them.

I'm not writing down a more detailed process on purpose so we can focus on the
general principles.

#### Job ads

Job ads in our industry are a joke. Ad titles are ridiculous: are you
looking for a "Jedi" JavaScript programmer? A "warlord" backend developer? Or a
"kick-ass" application developer? Maybe your titles are more like the classic
type: a rock star or a ninja. These ads foster a culture of white male kids that
read Hacker News and think they're the smartest kids on the block. This culture
is a complete no-go for a diverse team. Use titles that are descriptive of the
roles. For example, "Frontend developer" is just fine. You can add "Senior" or
"Junior" to your titles as long as you know what they mean to your organisation.
In fact, it's a good exercise to think about your definition of those words. The
conversation often leads to interesting outcomes. There may be a disagreement
within you teams, and converging to a common understanding is a great outcome of
every conversation.

The content of the ads presents similar problems:

- Buzzwords and business talk with no meaning.
- Too strict or non relevant requirements.

The buzzwords mostly indicate you either copied and pasted your ad or you let
your HR people write it for you. Either way it means you didn't dedicate enough
time to the first point of contact between your organisation and your next hire.
If you write your own ads, you can remove all the nonsense and show to
potential candidates that you care about people in this first interaction. One
other reason to write your own ads: it helps you set requirements that make
sense.

Some examples of nonsensical requirements:

- X years of experience with Y

  This isn't inclusive. Some people I met in my career would read something
  like "5 years of experience with X" and say "Well, I read a blog post once
  about X so I guess I'm cool". That's a problem because it wastes everyone's
  time. But false negatives should worry you even more. Many talented candidates
  that read this requirement would think "Oh, I have only 4.5 years of
  experience: I can't apply". Use a different wording to achieve the same
  result. I write something along the lines of "Proven experience on multiple
  projects with X". It covers the 4.5 years case too, and it's more inclusive
  writing. Furthermore, as one of the best people I've ever worked with would
  say, "X years of experience means nothing if you have done it wrong for X
  years". It's not the amount of years you spend working on something that
  matters – but the quality of that experience.

- Degree or equivalent

  The only significant difference I noticed in people with a degree is that they
  sometimes start a sentence with "I've read in this book that you call that X".
  Well, I would hardly consider that a plus. Sometimes it can even be
  counterproductive. I met people too attached to the theory and what their
  books tell them. But most programming we do isn't engineering in that sense,
  it's more of a craft. In our job, the practice turns out to be more important
  than the theory in a vast majority of cases.

- Use of design patterns

  I see this requirement way too often. Maybe it means that if you didn't read
  this book you aren't cool. I have a hard time understanding it. I don't
  think it's ever happened to me to say or to hear someone else say: "I think we
  should use the visitor pattern here". Don't get my wrong: it's a decent
  book. But that doesn't justify it as a requirement in a job ad. There is a
  great number of people out there that you want to hire who didn't read this
  book and they get along just fine.

- Git and GitHub

  This is taken for granted by many hiring managers. You must be familiar with
  those two if you want to work in the industry. This is a seriously broken
  assumption. On average, we use a small subset of the tool features in our daily
  workflows. It takes a couple of sessions with a more experienced person to
  learn the basics. Are you willing to close the door on talent because of a few
  hours?

  GitHub is only one of the tools people use to develop software. Don't fall for the
  idea that everyone uses it, it's obviously not true. You have to teach
  new hires how to use your internal tooling. You can look at GitHub the same
  way – it's just one tool.

- Side projects

  This translates loosely to "we want to hire only people that had enough free
  time in the past to have a pet project". I assume the intentions of this
  requirement is to underline you like people with a passion for learning and
  experimenting. If that's your intention, write that.

The purpose of requirements is to filter people out. Don't filter people out
because you are used to copying and pasting a requirement. Don't give people the
impression that you don't care enough about hiring them to write a few
meaningful lines about why they should come work with you.

#### Screening

When it comes to hiring, everything is harder than it looks. Screening
candidates is no exception. For starters, don't leave the screening to one
person in your team. I see this happening often unfortunately; I made this
mistake myself more than once. If you work with more than one team, you can't
do the screening for all your teams, it doesn't scale. Try to figure out with
the teams if people would fit in their team, teach the teams how to screen
candidates. Screening CVs as a team mitigates the risk of doing a bad screening
just because the one person doing it didn't start off the day on the right foot.
This process becomes expensive when you involve more people. But if you are
not willing to spend time on hiring, you aren't willing to build a great team.

Most HR tools let you rank candidates during screening, but there is no point in
doing so. The purpose of screening is filtering out as many people as possible
before you interview them. It's a harsh reality: you have to reject people
based only on their CV. Ask yourself if you want to work with the person behind
this CV. It's a closed-ended question that's designed to help you focus on the
purpose of the process. Screening is awful and I wish one could avoid it
altogether. But you can't avoid screening at scale: advertising brings many
candidates into the pipeline or, even better, your company is popular enough for
people to apply on their own. I know only two ways of avoiding screening:

- Actively reaching out to the people you would like to work with.
- Interviewing people referred by someone you know.

Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to feed the hiring pipeline only with
those activities. I thought about it a lot in the past, but I've never managed to
try it at scale. As everything, it has a downside: it closes the door to some
awesome candidates out of your network, which is obviously not inclusive. One
more downside of this approach: you are likely to reach out to people you consider fit
for your team. That doesn't necessarily mean enough diversity.

Another common technique for screening candidates is using code challenges. Do
not do this. Code challenges don't help you find the people you are looking
for. Here are some questions to help you frame the problem:

- How many times have you fired someone because of their technical skills?

  I never have. The problem was never the code. I had to let people go for many
  reasons: they misbehaved with co-workers, they couldn't find their place in
  the team, they didn't like the company. The problem was never the technical
  skills. Do you know why? Because that's the easy part of working in a team,
  it's the easy part of being a software developer. Interacting with other
  people, understanding requirements, building the right thing for your
  customers is the hard part.

- Are you not afraid of false positives?

  People that don't like code challenges wouldn't apply. If you think about it,
  you are giving the highest priority to writing the code. Is that what
  developers do all day? There is much more to the job than just writing code.
  Moreover, the more experienced you are, the less you try to solve a problem
  with just code.

Code challenges can feel like an exam and that can hurt your diversity efforts.
Many people performed badly at exams, I can personally relate to this as I've
always got really nervous when taking an exam. Code challenges also take up time.
Not all candidates have so much time to dedicate to you. They may be unhappy
at their company, but you can't infer how much they want to work with you by the
amount of free time they can dedicate to you. Some people have very busy
lives, and you may be filtering them out because your code challenge
takes half a day they don't have.

I never used a code challenge in my career and I still managed to hire
successfully. And yes, they all knew how to write the code.

#### Interviewing people

It's easy to intimidate people during interviews and scare great talent away.
To set the tone, I start interviews by telling candidates that I dislike the
concept and the format of interviews. Then I explain that I just want to talk to
them. It often makes people more comfortable because you are speaking to
candidates like a human being: they don't feel you are going to interrogate
them.

When you are planning the interviews for a candidate, be aware of the total
duration and timing of the process. It's easy not to be inclusive. I know of
companies that ask people to come over for a week and work for them. I
understand the intention, you don't want false positives, but such a lengthy
process leaves out all the candidates that don't have a spare week. I'm pretty
sure that there are fewer people with a spare week than without.

I suggest you schedule meetings taking candidates' needs into account. If
they meet you halfway, you are already on the right path. You don't want to
screen people out of your process because they can't make an arbitrary time
slot you chose for them.

You are trying to hire a person, not their CV, so don't ask candidates to list
all the technologies they know, or solve an algorithm on a whiteboard. It's
better to ask them about their background. How do they explain themselves and
their career path? Your goal is to understand who they're, what made them the
person and the developer they're today. Spend time understanding what they like
and what they don't like.

It's a common mistake to try matching your needs with someone's profile. The goal
is to understand if they actually are the person you are looking for. Candidates
are human beings, so they evolve constantly. They have different needs, they
come from different countries and have different goals. Asking them about their
past working experience, if they have any, is a great way to understand how
they got where they are today.

You can get technical if needed, but avoid questions like:

- What's `2^16`?
- What are your favourite data structures?
- What version of Ruby do you use?
- What's the difference between ArrayList and Vector in Java?
- How would you write pseudocode that reverses a linked list?

Those are real questions I have been asked. If you are asking such
ridiculous questions, I urge you to ask yourself why. What do you think is the
message your question sends? What's the outcome you expect?

I assume that people ask questions to assess candidates' experience level. But
these questions don't assess people's experience! They test for taste, memory,
and a little knowledge. These questions mistake knowledge for experience. It's
interesting to find out if someone you would like to work with has a good
memory, but that isn't as important as their experience in the field.
Experienced people know that our brains are much better equipped for processing
complex information than for storing it. It's not what you remember that makes you
an expert at something, but how you use your knowledge to complete a complex
task. Focusing on how they use knowledge leads to questions that better asses
people's experience level.

My favourite way is to ask broader questions whose answers change over time. You
have to be careful to design the questions so that people must use their own
experience to formulate an answer. I encourage you to think it over, don't
reject the idea right away. There are many technical questions
you can ask that are not "knowledge-based". Broader questions are better because
they don't focus on the small details, but rather on how deep the understanding
of a topic is. Here is a list of questions I ask depending on the context:

- What's your opinion on automated testing?
- Do you care more about a specific way of testing things?
- Why/when would you TDD?
- When do you think it's a good idea to rewrite a piece of software?
- What do you like or dislike about technology X?
- When you were working with technology X you said it was hard. Why?

These questions are designed to tell you how much time someone spent working
with X and what they really know about it. It's easy to figure out if a
candidate knows about X only because they've read a blog post about it. Their answer always
tells you.

Don't take these questions as a script though. The best interviews don't feel
like interviews at all. They are good conversations between people that have a
common goal: both parties are trying to understand if they would enjoy working
with each other. That's the goal.

#### Rejecting people

Be fast and always tell people where they stand in your process. I've failed
both at times and I'm ashamed of it. It's plainly wrong. Respecting the people
we interview is basic human decency. Try to be as thorough as possible in the
feedback you share about a rejection. If you don't have feedback to share, it
means you did something wrong in the interview process. Avoid using canned
answers for rejections, people hate canned answers. The reason is simple: people
hate it when you show no interest in them. Canned answers are fast and
automated answers, so they give people the impression you don't care about them. I'm
not saying canned answers are always wrong. I do use them in some
cases. Here is how I decide how to answer people:

- If both parties invested time in interviews and meetings, then I _always_
  craft an email.
- If I know there was no time investment for either party, then I use a canned
  answer. For example, sometimes you reject someone upfront because you don't
  see the value of bringing them to the interview stage. A fast canned answer is
  better than a slow crafted rejection with very little to share, and surely
  better than no answer at all.

Rejecting people is hard because it's harsh. No matter how you put it, you are
telling them you don't believe they're a good fit for your team; you are
telling them you don't want them in your team. The best you can do is tell them
the truth. When I started hiring on a monthly basis, this process became very
time consuming. I struggled to find a balance between having enough time to
work for my teams and treating candidates fairly. I learned a little trick that
changed everything for me. The idea is to book a little more time than you need
to interview someone. You plan to spend one hour with a candidate? Book one hour
and fifteen minutes. This way you have a buffer of time you can use to take
notes and write down your impressions while they're still fresh. It helps a
great deal especially if you end up rejecting the candidate. As leaders, we tend
to immediately move on to the next thing that requires our attention. We tend to
forget about things that are not relevant to us anymore. Sadly, people you are
about to reject belong to this category and it's only human to quickly forget
about the details. The notes I write down end up being the content of the email
I send to people, so I suggest you do the same. Write something like: "there
were two people for this position and I got a better feeling about the other one
because when we talked about X I thought Y" or "I felt more comfortable with
someone else because Z". Harsh sentences but don't worry about it, people
appreciate harsh truth more than soft lies. People offer to stay in touch
because the process was awesome. They remember your email because you showed
care in an interaction no one ever does. Being honest gives you the opportunity
to leave the door open for some candidates. You may reject someone because their
profile doesn't fit your company at the time of the process. But it may work
in a six-month time, so keeping the door open with some candidates may pay off.

### Hire slow

Most startups hire fast and fire slow and that's considered somehow normal. I
apply the exact reversed principle: hire slow and fire fast. This sounds
good in theory but it's hard in practice. Anything involving firing is hard.

Growing companies are constantly understaffed and hiring is the only way to
overcome the problem. It took me a while to accept that:

- You could always do more with more people.
- Hiring has no short-term positive performance effect on your teams.

More people in your team means you could do that one thing you never
manage to do. It's a stressful feeling and it was difficult coping with it at
times. But I learned that there is always an opportunity hidden behind every problem.
Here the opportunity is to do more with the people you already work with. Make
sure you always share with your team your hiring plans: it's a great
introspection process. People come up with plans to do more with less when they
have a better understanding of what's missing and what's relevant for the
upcoming future.

More people means more communication to manage, it's an obvious and necessary
overhead. Expecting spikes in the performances of your team is wrong. Instead,
plan for the obvious drops accordingly. Hiring can't fix your _now_ problems,
it's an investment for the future of your teams. Stay ahead of your own needs
and hire just a little before you need more people. This is how to make hiring a
slow process: you are always hiring for what you don't need just yet. As soon
as you find yourself saying "We need X developers now", you are three or four
months late and you can't recover from such a delay.

Hiring slow is your opportunity to minimise false positives, too. If you hire the
wrong people, the best you can do is to fire them. Unfortunately, that's an
awful solution. Firing is always a failure: something went wrong and now there
is no better option than giving up.

### Fire fast

Firing is ugly, there is no better way to put it. That's why I advocate for doing
it as soon as possible. I think of firing as the worst possible outcome of the
on-boarding process which I organise in the following checkpoints:

- First week
- First month
- First quarter

There is more to on-boarding than just looking for hiring failure, but let me
focus on that aspect for now. In the first few days, I only look for big red flags.
The kind of inappropriate behaviour that must result in immediate firing; sexist
or racist behaviour comes to mind. The one-month checkpoint is the first chance
for both parties to ask themselves if they did the right thing. A month is
generally enough to assess if you enjoy working together or not. At the third
month checkpoint, I ask myself the question "Do I want to work with this person
for the next X years?" and if the answer is not "Of course, she is awesome!" – I
know I have a problem to fix. Tell people the truth: explain in detail your
expectations and what isn't working. Follow up closely, as much as once per week
for a few months if needed. It's expensive, but it pays off if you are
proactive. Following up closely generates a reaction and that helps you
make the right decision. There are three possible outcomes:

- The problem gets fixed fast.
- The problem gets worse fast.
- Nothing happens.

It's easy to deal with the first two cases. If the problem gets fixed, great
news: you can work with this person. If it doesn't, bad news, but you now know
you can't work with this person. It gets trickier when nothing happens. In my
experience, this is the worst case scenario because you won't be able to
recover from this situation, but you can't say for sure yet. Maybe you can't
connect with the new member in order to help or, worse, they don't even care
about the issues you brought up. Talk to them every day if needed. If nothings
changes, you hired the wrong person or they chose the wrong company. The actual
reason doesn't make any difference to what you need to do.

Sometimes though, people don't fit anymore. They have been working with you for
a while and they realise they aren't happy anymore. Companies are living
entities. They evolve fast and there isn't anything wrong about this. In such
cases, you have to pay extra attention to how you let people go. It's easy
for both parties to show lack of care and leave behind a bad feeling. Once
again, the solution is talking as much as possible about it. They helped you
achieve your goals, now it's your turn to show them you appreciate what they've done.
Some people don't behave nicely in their last weeks and it can happen
even with people you really liked working with. It's human: their heart is
somewhere else already and they can't help it. Observe the situation closely. If
it gets unprofessional, talk to them and let them go as soon as possible. It's
the best option.

## Junior developers

I don't like the sentence "junior developer". It's not meaningful. There is no
universal definition of "junior" or "senior" developer because seniority is
not a mono-dimensional path. There are many ways to grow as a professional and
we're always going to be junior at some things. For these reasons, I feel the
need to clarify what I mean when I say "junior developers".

I use the term to describe people with no professional experience. They seem to
deserve special treatments in our industry. Some leaders argue that:

- You shouldn't bother hiring junior people because:
  - The overhead on senior people slows you down.
  - There isn't enough time to mentor them.
- Junior developers are good to change the copy on the website.
- Junior developers are just good for testing features, so we prefer to write tests.

This is awful and awfully common. Other leaders have a better approach to junior
developers, but they still suggest special treatment:

- You should put junior people all together so they can learn.
- You should offer them simple tasks so they can learn.

I consider any special treatment for junior developers to be plainly wrong. The
problem is exactly that: considering them _special_. There isn't anything
special about being a junior developer.

I apply this principle so rigorously that I ran into an interesting problem once. A
junior developer joining one of my teams felt under pressure because of their
lack of knowledge. I didn't understand the problem until I did the most obvious
thing you should do when you don't understand something: I asked. They were
stressed by the idea that they had to perform and produce as much as everyone else in
the team. After all, I was indeed treating them as everybody else. My mistake
was obvious in hindsight: I didn't clarify as much as I should have that there is
_one_ difference between junior team members and the more senior ones:
expectations. Since it may happen to you too, I suggest you tell junior
developers what's expected of them with great care. Personally, I expect them
to learn and ask many questions on a daily basis. All the questions are worth
asking and no question is too easy to bother answering.

If you mentor juniors to never fear asking questions and create a
safe environment for their learning process, they glue your teams together.
Senior people often fall for the law of the instrument:

> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

They also tend to mistake things they learned a long time ago for easy things.
These issues explain some symptoms your teams may have:

- Your teams do something unnecessarily complex because they did this in the
  past and it worked. You miss out on innovation. You miss out on simplifying
  your system because something more complex worked in the past and your teams
  know about it.
- Your teams think they are always right. Of course no one is always right.
  Self-doubting your own solutions helps as long as it doesn't get you stuck.
- Your senior developers may be senior only technically speaking. I ran into
  this problem often in my career because it's easy to get distracted by their
  technical knowledge. Expect senior people to mentor and encourage the growth of
  junior team members. Junior developers help you figure out _if_ you
  actually have senior team members.

Junior developers ask you why you do something in a certain way no matter how long
you've been doing it. They don't know about your status quo and assumptions yet.
They debug your systems just by asking questions. They find what's wrong with
your documentation by reading it with contextless fresh eyes. The benefits
outgrow the investment every single day. You _always_ need junior developers.

Our industry is so broken that most of us accept that everyone else needs to have the
shitty experience we had as junior developers. I remember my first job and I
look back at it often. It was awful and I was surrounded by people that thought
I had to earn their trust before they could teach me something. I abhor this
leadership style. We must do better than that. We must _be_ better than that.

A reminder: you are still a junior at almost everything in life and you will
always be. Teaching people what you know makes you better at what you do. Junior
people make your seniors better because of that.
