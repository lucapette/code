# Culture

> What you say isn't your culture. What you do is your culture.

Culture is everything you do. It's the way you speak to each other, how you use
your tools, document your processes and decisions. Culture is how aware your
teams are of the processes they follow and how happy they're working in the
company. Culture is how you write your ads for your job posting, the way you
talk to candidates, how you hire or reject them. Culture is how you take care of
every aspect of the work-life balance, the way you mentor your people, how you
give them feedback and how you praise them when they do something great. I could
go on for a long time but the point is: culture is everything you do, every
single day.

The challenge for me as a writer is that every statement like "X is everything
you do" is not the best starting point of a constructive conversation. If
everything is culture, how are you supposed to build yours? Should you care
about every single thing that happens in your teams? Should you control
everything? It's OK to struggle while you build a good culture. Obviously,
trying to control everything does not make you a good leader. At most, it can
make you a good micro-manager. On the other hand, you may end up building a team
that doesn't reflect the values you can get behind. How do you shape a culture
that produces values you are aligned with?

The first step is to accept that you can neither control nor forecast people's
behaviour. To overcome the struggle, leading by example is the simplest and most
effective approach. Instead of just telling people what is OK and what it not,
you show them everyday with your own behaviour. When people trust you, they tend
to emulate your behaviour. Be aware though, it's a double-edged sword:

- It's good because people naturally do what you consider good things. As
  you do what you think is best, people follow your best behaviour.
- It's bad because people emulate your mistakes too. I expand on that in
  [Lead by example](6-self-care.md#lead-by-example).

In the rest of the chapter, I focus my attention on how to shape a culture you
are aligned with and bring to light some aspects of culture that are often
underestimated in product development teams.

## Meetings

Meetings are a central part of the culture of any company because we spend a
great deal of time attending them. In our industry, there is a common sentiment
that meetings are a distraction from _real_ work. Developers feel unproductive
when they go to meetings. They can't wait to go back to _real_ work. This
sentiment has my sympathy, but it generally creates more problems that it
solves. Saying no to meetings is a good example of non-constructive criticism.
People don't see the value of most meetings they attend, therefore they feel
they need to go back to the _real_ work. You fix the problem by running
meetings that create value, meetings that people look forward to attending.

What meetings you make compulsory says a lot about your culture. By definition,
making something mandatory for the people you work with means you have a strong
opinion about it. Therefore, I suggest you think very carefully about the
meetings that must be compulsory. The shorter the list, the better. My list has
only two items: one-on-ones and retrospectives. Be aware that just declaring
some meetings compulsory doesn't work: people still need to find them valuable,
otherwise you get the worst possible effect. You forced people into recurrently
doing something they don't want to do. That's often how people start thinking of
leaving a company.

### One-on-ones

As a young programmer, I worked for a giant consulting company and one-on-ones
were a nightmare for me. My manager used the meeting for negative feedback only,
so when I was first asked to have one-on-ones with my direct reports, I was
afraid that my team would see me like I saw my manager. I wanted to mentor
people and support their growth. I was sceptical that one-on-ones would be in
line with my leadership style because I had only known bad one-on-ones. It's
funny how perspective can change with experience. Nowadays, one-on-ones are the
core of my leadership style and I wouldn't know how to lead without them.

In the industry, there is a lot of advice around how to structure and how to run
one-on-ones. My advice is to try hard to avoid structure: the meeting is about
one person at the time. All people are different, so good one-on-ones reflect
their diversity. The goal is to create a safe environment to foster trust. You
can't help people if you don't know what their inspirations are, what they
struggle with, what annoys them. Many people don't feel like they have the space
at their daily job for figuring out their professional and personal development.
Most people never bring up such vulnerable topics if not offered a safe space.
It's your job as a leader to create such a space.

If you are planning what to say in a one-on-one, it means you aren't leaving
enough room for the other person to make use of the meeting. You can't plan the
discussion because your primary job is to listen. Do the simple thing: ask
people how they want to use the meeting. Your job is to help them and they often
know better than you what they're struggling with. Ask questions to clarify
doubts and misunderstandings. Only propose topics if nothing comes up. If people
want to talk about non work related things, don't drive the conversation back to
work. One-on-ones are wonderful because they create the space to know each other
better. It's quite ironic how this works: we spend more hours per week with
people we know very little about than with people we know everything about. I'm
not sure how it works in other industries, but I'm sure we can't do a good job
building software if we don't know what is going on with our teams. It's basic
human decency and common sense. The strength of a team comes from its collective
intelligence: the better people know each other, the better their collaboration
is.

Even more ironic is how reluctant people are when I talk about one-on-ones as a
meeting that isn't about work during working hours. To be fair, my phrasing may
not be great. I say that one-on-ones aren't about work, and that's true only if
you consider work as a set of tasks to complete. We should not have such a
narrow view of what work is. We work with people and people complete tasks, so
one-on-ones are about the core of the job: the people doing it.

There is one thing you need to plan carefully though: your action points after a
one-on-one. When I'm teaching young leaders to run one-on-ones, I always spend a
great deal of time on this. One-on-ones can dramatically improve your
relationship with the people you work with, but they can also destroy it. I did
learn the hard way, and so did many leaders I mentored. Successfully creating a
safe space for people to tell you what bothers them and what their aspirations
are puts great expectations on you. People trusted you, so now you have to prove
that they did the right thing. Often, one-on-ones lead to action points like "I
will work on X because I understand now that it bothers you". The problem is
that you can't forget X anymore. If you do, people will stop trusting you. It
took me too long to understand that I needed to take great care of the action
points generated in one-on-ones. That's the main reason why you can hardly have
more than 4 or 5 direct reports _and_ do a good job at the same time. It's too
much work and too much information, so it's easy to make mistakes. This
limitation has practical implications on your organisational design, which I
discuss in [When to split teams](5-teams.md#when-to-split-teams).

One-on-ones make sense only as a recurring meeting, so their frequency is
relevant. My advice is not to choose the frequency yourself. Different people
have different needs, let them choose how often they want to meet. My only
requirement is upper bound: not less than once a month. Now, it can be once per
month, once per week, every day or whatever. I'm serious though, you work for
the people, remember? If someone needs to meet you everyday for a while, there
is no good reason to say no. In my experience, the frequency tends to fall
somewhere between every two weeks and once per month. During the first
one-on-one, I explain that this is their meeting and they can use it in whatever
way and however often they prefer.

If your one-on-ones have a different focus, mood, and rhythm depending on the person 
you're talking to, it's a clear sign you're doing a good job. If the experience
varies a lot, you're going in the right direction:

> People are different and you want to treat them differently. You don't want
> to treat all of them in the same way: you want to be equally fair with all of
> them.

Keep the meeting informal and, if people are fine with it, do it outside of the
typical office setup. Long walks are healthy and they stimulate a good
conversation, so that's a good choice and creates a ritual. Some people hate
walking and talking though, so make sure your direct reports agree with the
setup. Having the meeting outside of the default meeting setup helps you
reinforce the message that "This meeting has a special meaning because it's only
about you and not all the other work stuff". The meetings are more formal with
some people and "exactly like going for a coffee" with other people. Both are
fine.

### Retrospectives

Every day at work there is so much to accomplish. We test new ideas, ship new
features, break our systems, then fix them. These things often happen multiple
times per day, often simultaneously. It's exciting to work in such an
environment; it's dynamic and fun and there aren't two days that look the same.
But, as almost everything in life, it may have negative side-effects: it's easy
to end up running in a hamster wheel without really realising it. We constantly
think about what is next: the next feature, the next bug fix, the next problem
to solve. Always looking at the next thing doesn't tell you enough about the
direction and progress. You need a point of reference for that: your past. If
you don't stop and look back at where you're coming from, you don't really know
where you're going. So you need to stop and look back on a regular basis as much
to make sure you aren't running in circles.

Retrospectives are how you systematically look at the past. One interesting
aspect of retrospectives is their "kaizen" effect. Kaizen is Japanese for
"improve" and it's a fancy term the industry uses to refer to "continuous
improvement". Retrospectives are a great tool for self-improvement, but here is
another great aspect of retrospectives: it makes people stop running for some
time. The messages you can reinforce with these meetings are:

- You don't need to run all the time.
- It's OK to stop and reflect.
- It's OK to spend some time just thinking.

Messages are easier to digest when repeated over time, so set up the meeting to
be recurrent. Decide with your teams how often you want to run retrospectives. I
find 2-week cycles to work well: it's long enough to gather topics for a
discussion, but short enough to keep the conversation focused.

As a leader, how should you approach retrospectives? A good approach is to think
of them as a collective one-on-one. You are there to clarify misunderstanding,
to make small suggestions. You don't need to drive the conversation in any
specific direction. Sometimes though, you may find yourself in a retrospective
where people don't know what to talk about or where to start. This happens, and
here is my way out of it: ask the team to name one thing they would like to
improve. It's a start. Avoid suggesting topics for retrospectives. A good topic
is whatever your team think they should improve on. It can be about improving
the way you test things, it can be about getting more light in the room, a
better webcam for remote work. The actual topic doesn't really matter. What
matters is that you have the meeting on a recurrent basis and then act on the
outcomes. During the meeting, think of yourself as a mediator. Some people are
very vocal, others not so much. You are there to ensure everyone gets a chance
to share their opinion. This is extremely important because often vocal people
have little to say. That's why they're so vocal about it: they're afraid no one
would care about their opinion if they wouldn't shout it out. If you let this
phenomenon run its course, you may lose constructive feedback. I call it "the
Hacker News comments effect". Most times, people that don't shout out their
opinion have something meaningful to say. Listen to them and give them the
opportunity to voice their opinion.

A good retrospective has clear outcomes. Your job is to look for those outcomes
and make sure the team works on them. People doing the job are too focused on
the details of what they're doing, so there is a chance they get caught in the
everyday "run, run, run" vibe and forget about their own intentions to improve.
Having a document that stores the discussions and the outcomes of retrospectives
is helpful. People can go back to it and members of other teams can learn from
it. As for one-on-ones, following up on the outcomes is the most important
aspect.

Let me indulge on the parallel with one-on-ones a little more, it helps me
explain how to run a good retrospective. There are many techniques to run
retrospectives, but it's risky to apply the same techniques to different teams.
Don't assume you can structure and run retrospectives for different teams in the
same way. It's hard to imagine techniques that "just work" for any team. I'm
not suggesting that you don't need to know about good techniques to run
retrospectives. I'm suggesting that you try things out until you find something
that works for each team. Every team is unique, so chances are different
techniques work for different teams.

Running retrospectives takes practice, so don't fear going a little meta. It's
good to sit down and discuss how you run retrospectives and what you can change
to get even more out of them. The thinking process slows down your teams even
more, and that's a great side-effect. People take their time to think how to
improve the way they work.

Our goal is to build software that works for customers. Building something
really fast that no one can use isn't a recipe for success. Our industry puts a
lot of emphasis on the speed of development and not enough on the quality of the
outcomes. Boyd's law of iteration says it all:

> Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration.

It's often misinterpreted. We pay too much attention to the wrong aspect of the
law. It's not much about speed per se, it's about the _speed of iteration_ of
your processes. Retrospectives may slow you down a little, but they give you
fast feedback about your processes and the health status of a team you wouldn't
have otherwise. These meetings help you stay focused on the right aspect of
Boyd's law.

### Set up your policies

In [Process](4-process.md), I state that no process is a process too, and most
likely a bad one. The same concept applies to culture and meeting policies. From
time to time, you may run into statements like "we have no HR department" or "we
have no managers", "we're a flat org", and so on. It's a fashion, especially in
the startup world, to take thing X with a bad reputation and say out loud "We
have no X" or "We don't do X anymore". This fashion has no substance and fosters
what I call the "Hacker News white dudes readers" culture. Other people call it
the "tech bros" culture. A much better attitude toward things with a bad
reputation is "We don't like X too, so we did Y about it". You often hear "We
don't have meeting policies because we hate meetings". This is just not helpful:

- No policy is just a bad policy.
- No meetings at all isn't a practical answer.

A better strategy is to make meetings better instead of hating them. I
suggest to maintain a living document that specifies at least:

- Strategies to avoid meetings.
- How to determine who is required.
- How to determine who is optional.
- How to write a meeting invitation that says who is running the meeting, includes
  an agenda and expected outcomes.
- How to take notes, what to document as an outcome, and how to document it.

Writing suggestions on how to avoid having a meeting isn't so easy to do.
Moreover, it's not easy to build a culture that strives to avoid meetings.
Instead, you can define what makes a meeting a productive activity. I consider a
meeting productive if we don't have to meet again to discuss the same topics or
until there is significant progress. For example, if the topic is something like
"We want to introduce X as a storage because Y doesn't scale anymore", I
consider the meeting productive if the outcome is either "We decided not to
introduce X because we're still fine with Y, we will meet in 6 months again to
check the status" or "We decided to introduce X. We plan to do this and that. We
will meet again once a prototype is in place". Based on this definition, a
meeting can't be productive unless it has a clear goal; you can rely on the
goal's clarity to figure out if you are ready to meet. Don't underestimate
meeting preparation: you can talk to the people one-on-one or write a proposal
about what you intend to discuss in the meeting. Such activities help you figure
out if you really need a group of people to stop doing whatever they're doing
and meet you. There is a big difference between "I need to book your time
because I have no clue how to do X" and "I researched X and I can't proceed
without your input on X because Y".

In my career, I've received thousands of meeting invitations with no
description. I'm not entirely sure I know why that is, but I now know it's a bad
sign. I tend to overdo descriptions because I believe that over-communication
wins against under-communication every day. Be emphatic with invitees. If you
get invited to a meeting, there are some things you need to know, and you feel
comfortable attending if you have that information. You want to know why, what,
who. You want to know the agenda and the expected outcome. Otherwise, it's like
going to a party without knowing the address nor the host, the dressing code,
the kind of food or music. It's possible to attend such a party, but it's
probably not going to be enjoyable. It's supposed to be common sense to write
down a good description, but since that doesn't seem to be the case, sharing
guidelines helps people write their own descriptions.

Sometimes you go into a meeting and no one kicks it off. No one knows who is
supposed to say what. These are the uncomfortable seconds in which people look
at their phones, check their email on their laptop (it's worth mentioning in the
policy document when it's OK to bring the laptop to a meeting). If a meeting
starts this way, the host didn't do their job. Someone must run the meeting and
the host is my default choice. What really matters though is that someone does
run the meeting, and their name is explicitly stated in the invitation. This way
people have a guide, and the host has a clear a responsibility. It generally
leads to better run meetings where people get a chance to voice their opinion
and no one thinks they wasted their time.

## No privileges, no elites

In [Teams](5-teams.md), I spend a great deal of time talking about
organisational design. It's such an important and fascinating topic to me, I
dedicated a whole chapter to it. The way you organise functions and roles inside
teams plays a central role in culture too, so let's explore that.

The cultural aspect of organisational design starts with privileges and
policies. In most environments, there is some degree of privilege when it comes
to specific topics like deployment rights, access to different environments. A
common explanation for these privileges is risk mitigation. Those in charge want
to minimise the mistakes you can make, so they grant privileged access only to a
handful of people. This approach creates a false sense of security, when in fact
these companies aren't doing better than any other company out there. They have
outages and break things like everybody else. In reality, these privileges
create the worst dynamic: it frustrates younger team members because they can't
access some obvious knowledge that would increase their seniority. It also makes
sure that only seniors can make mistakes. Getting rid of all forms of privilege
may sound scary, but there is no need to freak out:

> Saying everyone can do anything doesn't mean everyone will.

On average, this doesn't bring much change in terms of risk. You won't get more
outages. Why would you? Leaving the doors open increases the chances of getting
a smarter team. If you remove all privileges, chances are someone will make
mistakes, which is a direct consequence of their ability to access everything.
As a leader, you may find yourself wishing a team member didn't have access to
that part of the system. The train of thoughts is so common: "If they hadn't had
access to the server, that incident wouldn't have happened". It can lead you to
believing that a degree of privilege is a practical answer. You would be fooling
yourself: trying to avoid mistakes is a silly strategy that builds a silly
culture. Mistakes _will_ happen and, as a leader, you must welcome them because
you can teach people how to react to them and what they can do so that the
problem doesn't occur again. Use mistakes as a learning opportunity by
implementing a post-mortems policy.

Apply the "no privileges" policy aggressively. People should not be confined to
only one phase of your product development process. Of course, people specialise
because they care more about one thing or the other, and it's important they can
freely develop in the direction they want. Our systems are too complex for
people to know the details of everything. But don't assign those specialties any
privilege. In fact, I reject the notion of privilege entirely. If one can do
something in a team, everyone else can do it too.

In my career, I couldn't always apply a full "no privilege" policy. That's only
possible if the person in charge fully supports the policy. Working in teams
that foster a privilege-based culture has been a frustrating experience, but it
gave me the opportunity to gather interesting data. I had a chance to A/B test
policies. In almost 20 years of data collection, I observed that privileges have
no effect on the amount of incidents. Moreover, the people making "big mistakes"
were most times the most senior in the team. The same people that would have had
the privileges to perform the task anyway if there had been a policy.

Before moving on, I must address a point of confusion that often comes up in
conversations around this topic. The word "privileges" has a technical meaning
too. Think about granting permissions to drop tables on a database. So I often
run into the argument that "no privileges, no elites" isn't a practical
approach. The critique comes from focusing on two things:

- Understanding "privilege" as a technical word.
- Ignoring the "no elites" part.

This section is in a chapter called "Culture", and that's my point. There are
valid technical reasons to restrict permissions, access, and so on. Often
enough, there are even legal reasons to do so. That's not in contrast with "no
privileges, no elites". The point is that there are no good cultural reasons to
have privileged team members. Those are the ones you want to avoid.

## Documentation

Conversations around documentation in the context of software development aren't
easy because developers have the tendency to equate documentation to documenting
code. That has a bad reputation in the industry. There are so many quotes about
good code not needing comments and as many jokes about comments being always out
of date. These jokes and quotes make a fair argument in favour of writing better
code - who wouldn't agree with that anyway? But they devalue documentation as a
whole. It's easy to see people stretching these arguments to the point of saying
that not writing any documentation is fine because the code is documentation.

Documentation says a lot about the culture of a company, and the so common
absence of documentation says a lot about the culture of our whole industry.
Once again, the problem is that we focus too much on the code. Working in a software
development team comes with many responsibilities that aren't closely
connected to the code:

- What recurrent meetings are you required to attend?
- How do you operate your own systems?
- What does that funny acronym mean?
- What are you supposed to do if something breaks?

Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea. Being a developer doesn't
mean writing code all day long. It's called software development, not code
typing. Being a developer means participating in the activity of building a
system _with_ code. A big chuck of these activities change at a completely
different pace than the code itself. You deploy changes to your system multiple
times per day (and if you don't, why not?), but it's highly unlikely that you
change the way you operate your systems or your required meetings every day.
From that perspective, half of the jokes we make about code comments becoming
outdated at the speed of light don't apply. Also, the idea that code must be so
simple that it's self-explanatory doesn't apply, because code can't explain
funny acronyms. Code tells you how, but can't tell you why. Documentation is an
expression of company culture because good documentation makes people
comfortable and confident.

The way you document what you do, how you do it, and why you do it says how much
you care. Most companies don't document any of it; they're fine with their
culture being ambiguous. I strongly recommend to have a developer book: a small
manual that documents the way you do things, how you do them, and why. In
[Developer book](3-communication.md#permanent-channels), I discuss how to
structure, share, and evolve such a document. Here I want to focus on the
aspects of the document that impact your culture: a developer book makes a big
difference to the onboarding process. How much you care about new-joiners and
how easy it is for them to get up and running is a defining aspect of every
company. In most cases, it takes months to understand the vocabulary of a
company or why some servers are called like stars and others like "Rick and
Morty" characters. A few brief documents have a great impact on the way teams
work together and clarify what things really matter to you. These documents help
you foster a documentation culture which makes people better writers.

In order to mitigate the bad reputation documentation suffers from, I focus my
personal writing efforts on explaining the whys of things. A common problem with
documentation is that we just document what we do. But the actual power of
documentation comes from explaining why we do things the way we do them. A good
example is commit messages. They often describe the code change literally. That
isn't helpful, because the version control system can do that. Knowing _why_
changes everything, because it gives people context about the change itself.
Bear in mind that commit messages are just an example. The point is, you have to
make sure that documentation is valued by your teams. Leading by example goes a
long way: write documents that explain why you are doing something, don't send a
memo out that just says something is happening.

## Share everything by default

Everything is harder at scale. We know it well in the industry, and we
continuously come up with ways to overcome the pain of scaling small prototypes
into big enterprise applications. Scaling teams means scaling communication and
nothing is harder than scaling communication. It's a broad and complicated
topic, with many aspects and many details to discuss. That's why I dedicate the
entire next chapter to communication. Here I focus only on the cultural aspect
of communication.

Good culture makes people comfortable with the information you share with them.
In the first years of my career as a manager, I often found myself wishing I had
shared more about this or that decision. At some point, I realised that I could
be doing much better if I stopped asking myself what was worth sharing. Now I
know that, by default, everything is worth sharing. Choosing what to tell and,
more importantly, what not to tell to the people you work with isn't the best
way to frame the problem. Nowadays, I ask myself "Do I have a _very_ good reason
to not share this yet?". The answer is almost exclusively no. But, before I dig
into the implications of this approach, let me clarify what _by default_ means:
personal information about people in your teams should not be shared. Best is to
let people choose if and how to communicate personal matters to the rest of the
team.

When it comes to work-related information, sharing everything by default is the
best approach. I readily admit that's hard to put into practice. The first time
I asked myself the question "What would be a good reason to not share this
yet?", I figured that every answer I tried to come up with was dictated by
either control or defence on my part. I then started sharing everything by
default. It took many weeks of practice before I felt at ease with it. First of
all, I feared that some information may not be relevant for some folks in the
team. Guessing how relevant information is to people is difficult because it's
indeed just a guess. It doesn't matter how good you are at it, you do get it
wrong from time to time.

Here are a few possible scenarios:

- Info is relevant and you don't share it

  This is the worst scenario. It frustrates people and makes them feel excluded.

- Info is relevant and you share it

  Best-case scenario.

- Info isn't relevant and you share it

  You create some noise.

- Info isn't relevant and you don't share it

  Best case scenario.

Sharing everything by default simplifies the decision process. It does
eliminate the worst case scenario altogether, but it creates some noise. The
best way of coping with the noise is to build as many communication
channels as possible with two properties: public and optional. Give everyone
the ability to access every form of communication, but let people decide how to
consume it. This approach empowers people more and it makes them responsible for
what they want to be informed about. Different people have different needs: some
people need a lot of information, others – very specific details. Sharing
everything by default makes your communication more inclusive.

If I look back at the times I regretted not sharing enough with my teams, timing
has often been the driving force keeping me away from sharing everything by
default. When is the right time to share something? This is the core question
you need to answer to correctly implement this policy. Let's break it down:

- Facts are easy. You can just share them as soon as possible.

- Thoughts and ideas are harder to share because if you share them too soon,
  then they are raw information. People may not have the tools to consume them
  correctly. If you are in a leading position, your ideas may be confused for
  decisions already taken. To make things trickier, you spend a great deal of
  time thinking about the future. Most of your thoughts aren't relevant for the
  specific problem the teams are working on _right now_. That continuous
  projection in the future generates many hypothesis, unfinished thoughts,
  untested ideas. It's a good thing; it's important you practice strategic
  thinking. But it's a slow process too, so some thoughts slowly turn into more
  concrete ideas and final proposals.

Finding the right time to share this information is hard, but you can use it at
the advantage of your leadership style. If people can't see the evolution of
your thinking over time, change might be likely perceived as "the boss said so".
As harsh as this may sound, the way your teams perceive changes or proposals is
always on you. Being in charge means being able to explain change. Making people
part of this process is the biggest benefit of sharing by default. Good timing
and overcoming the fear of sharing too much can be achieved by designing
different channel of communications. Using different styles for thoughts, ideas,
policy, decisions, and so on. That's the topic of the next chapter.
