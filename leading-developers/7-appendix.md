# Appendix

In this section, I share resources I found formative for my leadership career.

## Books

The following list of books had a high impact on my leadership style. As you may
notice, there are no books from the "engineering management" category. I
think you probably come across these books anyway.

### The checklist manifesto

If you are reading this after you've read the whole book, you
already know I love checklists. I considered having a section about it in
[Process](4-process.md) but decided against it. I can't make a better job than
this short, exquisite book.

I often say "checklists are unit tests for your processes". The inspiration for
the quote comes from this book. It often amazes me how a small checklist
can positively impact team work. The book makes a compelling argument for using checklists
everywhere.

### The inmates are running the asylum

I didn't want to read a book with such a strange title, but I'm glad I
got past it and decided to read it anyway.

Fair warning: the first part of the book is really harsh on developers. The
wording is strong and the content isn't good for your ego. But the perspective
is eye opening. It made me much more sympathetic to how product managers see
work. Leading developers often means having a closer relationship with product
management, so this book can help you widen your perspective.

### The goal

Most of "my version of Kanban" ideas come from this book. It's written in an
interesting style; [Camille Fournier](https://www.camilletalk.com/) calls it
"business erotica" and I think it's perfect.

The book is a page turner. It radically improved my understanding of flow
production and queuing theory. It helped me improve significantly the way 
I approach the product development value stream.

## Podcasts

I have a strange relationship with podcasts as a media. I can listen to tons of
podcasts every week for a few months in a row. But then, without any apparent
explanation, I can't stand the media. I'm not sure why this is.

If I had to recommend only one podcast, it would be [Greater than
code](https://www.greaterthancode.com/). The conversations on this podcast are
sometimes so deep that you could write a book about them.

I also like to listen to [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast). 
The topics are really varied and always interesting.

## Blogs

Here's a list of blogs, in no particular order, that I love. One way or the
other, these writers made me a better leader:

- [Elided Branches](https://www.elidedbranches.com/)
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)
- [Lin Clark](https://code-cartoons.com/)
- [Charity.wtf](https://charity.wtf/)
- [Tania Rascia](https://tania.dev/)
- [Julie Zhuo](https://juliezhuo.com/)

You may have noticed this list doesn't contain a single man. I really wanted to
add at least one, for diversity's sake, but why would I lower the quality of my
recommendations?
