# Self-care

> Your worst behaviour sets the low bar for your teams. Protect your team by

Leading a team of developers is an exciting and privileged job but it can be
hard on you. It's especially difficult when you are leading a team for the
first time.

One challenge is that we often see leadership as a form of heroism: being a
leader means being the best at what you do, it means knowing everything. There
are many problems with this:

- People who think they know it all are poor performers. There is some
  fascination in pop culture (think of how we represent geniuses in movies) with
  people that have all the answers, so it does reflect in our everyday
  assessment and biases. The goal of a good leader, though, isn't to be a
  know-it-all. The goal is to be as helpful as possible. We're all juniors at
  almost everything we do, so it's more beneficial to focus on how to face
  problems while learning and how to teach other people to do the same.
- Some developers do expect their leaders to be the best developers in their
  team. A leader must be better than them, right? Well, no. It just paints
  a wrong picture of what leadership is.

If you are in this trap, you end up isolating yourself from the team, because you
can't ask for help when in need. The "best" do it all alone, don't they?

You can guess why I'm quoting these words. Being the "best" at something doesn't
mean much unless you're taking part in an actual competition. Isolation isn't
a solution. Vulnerability is. The rest of the chapter expands on this.

To care for others, you have to care for yourself. As much as I don't like how
cliché this sounds, it's true. You need enough personal space so you learn how
to protect yourself from your own sense of responsibility towards your teams. At
times, it's hard to remember that. After all, a job is just a job. You are much
more than just your job; if you don't take care of yourself, no one else will.

## Lead by example

Leading by example is the best way to shape culture: instead of telling people
how to behave, be the person you want your team members to be. It sounds easy in
theory, but it's hard in practice.

On the one hand, leading by example does wonders because it's self-reproducing.
People have the tendency to emulate the behaviour of those they trust. If people
trust you as a leader, you can shape the culture of your team _just_ by doing
what you think is right.

On the other hand, people tend to emulate your mistakes, too. Whatever you do
is seen as acceptable behaviour by default. So correcting the course can get
hard: if you didn't live up to your own values, why do you expect others
to do better than you?

It's a challenge with a surprisingly simple solution: be honest and open about
your own mistakes. Being vulnerable has a positive effect on the entire team. By
admitting your mistakes in public, you are saying:

- It's OK to make mistakes.
- You must do better.
- So must everyone else.

By being vulnerable you show your team the best response at times
of crisis. You are leading by example.

Leading by example means you continuously rely on your values and put them into
practice. While a good overlap between your personal values and the
"professional" values of your teams is necessary, it wouldn't be realistic to
expect a perfect match between your personal values and the professional values
of your organisation. At times, it can be stressful to deal with the difference,
so I suggest you document the values you stand by as a team. A bulleted list with
five or six values is enough. You can think of this exercise as writing a
concise essay about "what we stand by at this company".

## Protect your time

Leadership is about people, so the everyday job mostly means doing things with
other people: one-on-ones, interviews with candidates, spontaneous meetings. It
can get busy to the point that you may spend days in the company of other
people. While there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with spending work time
with your teams, a balance is still necessary. You may go on for days or weeks
before realising that you're always running. It's too busy, but bad busy. Being _so_
busy may feel like an accomplishment. After all, you're always doing relevant
work; you have the interest of your team at heart, so what's wrong with it?

Well, you are ignoring yourself. While I stand by the point that good leadership
is servant leadership that puts people first, you can't overdo it. There are
many problems ignoring yourself may bring about:

- Your technical skills stagnate

  Going from one meeting to another means you are in operational mode.
  You jump from one topic to another. From one one-on-one to the next. You learn
  lots of new things here and there, but there is no breakthrough development in
  your technical growth. If you are a developer yourself, you may miss writing
  code. Moreover, technology evolves fast, and you never get around to getting
  your hands dirty with what your teams are doing. If you are always in the
  company of other people, you don't have the time for that anymore.

- You lose sight of the big picture

  Let me bring back the car metaphor. If you are driving a car, you lose some
  details of the road. You get a sense of how to get from A to B, you could
  probably do it again. The bigger the team, the more complicated it gets. You
  need the time to leave the road and look at all the cars from afar.
  Sometimes, you find interesting patterns. You can't do any deep thinking if
  you are always in the company of other people.

To mitigate these problems, you need to protect your time. In my experience,
being as systematic as possible is key. I literally protect my calendar from my
own commitments. Here is what works for me:

- I block 2 slots of 4 hours (a day per week) in my calendar. Most calendars
  have a "working hours" feature. I use that.
- I never make exceptions, and never schedule any occasional meetings during these blocks.
- I enjoy my "free time".

However you create your "free time", it's crucial that you actually use it
productively. A great way of doing so is to come up with a project that
covers personal innovation, big picture, and building. This project has to be
pertinent to your job. My favourite projects are small
utilities to improve neglected parts of the development workflow. I love the
multiplying effect that such an initiative can have on the teams.

I've been protecting my time since I first started leading. I must warn you:
it's harder than it seems. In practice, it's way too easy to end up spending
months without any personal time. It happened to me more than once, and knowing
that this may happen again didn't seem to help. That's why I'm advocating for hard
rules. Budget your time, block your calendar, and stick to your plan. You'll
thank yourself later.

## Delegate

Every month or so, I go for a walk and think about my teams' work from a
specific point of view. I look for things I would have done differently, and I
start to worry if I can't find at least a few. If I agree with everything they've
done, chances are I'm too close to the team and both of the following
things are happening:

- Some initiatives are going wrong but I can't see it. I'm too involved in
  everything to see the big picture.
- I'm not leaving the team enough space to get off the script and get something
  wrong. Often this means I'm not delegating enough.

Good leadership isn't about building a team that always gets it right: it's
about helping people find a way to learn from their mistakes.
What you want is responsible freedom. Let people do
whatever they think is best to achieve the outcomes you agreed upon. Then hold
them accountable by _what_ outcomes they produce and not by _how_ they produce
them. This approach helps you more than anyone else. It makes your team
grow faster and you can delegate more and more to them.

Delegating is harder to practice if you only see it as a tool to get things
done. Getting something done yourself often has a faster turnaround
than delegating it to someone else. I have struggled with this and I know of many
leaders who also found this challenging. What helped me overcome this challenge
is looking at delegation primarily as a mentoring technique. The idea is to know
what kind of activity serves better the person you're delegating to. Don't
delegate just to get more things done. It's a wasted opportunity.

Delegating also needs balance. There is a risk of delegating too much and losing
contact with the everyday reality of the people you work with. Every now and
then, I choose a non-trivial (but also non-critical) task for myself to make
sure I'm still in contact with what the "doing part" of the job looks like. The
outcome of this activity can be surprising. If you always stick to your usual role,
you may discover problems about the day-to-day operations that both you and your teams
have trouble seeing. A real-world example I've run into more than once is
build pipeline times:

- It's not a given that you, as a leader, know how long it takes to build a
  system if you don't work with it every day.
- Build times often degrade so slowly over time. The team may not
  realise how much worse it got.

When you run into such a problem, use it as a collective learning opportunity.
Don't fix it yourself or, worse, ask someone to fix the problem. Make it a
conversation, help yourself and the team to see how you got there and what's the
best course of action.

## Get a mentor

Having someone you trust and you can rely on for advice and direction is
important for your mental health and professional growth. Of course your
direct manager plays an important role, they should be a point of reference and someone
you can look up to. But even when you really like and trust your manager, you may
find yourself wishing you had someone else to talk to. The nature of the
relationship between you and your manager is, by definition, a professional one.
When you talk to them about work, it's a professional conversation. Sometimes,
though, you may not be ready to share some information with them. The
thoughts feel unfinished and talking to someone else could help.

If you don't have a mentor, you increase the chances of keeping too many things
to yourself. These unfinished thoughts grow on each other. You're working on
them. You aren't emptying your mental backlog of thoughts.

This work in progress of unfinished ideas has a direct impact on your
professional and personal life: the weight overwhelms you at some point
because there are literally too many thoughts in your head. I strongly recommend
you to get a mentor to overcome these problems. A mentor can help you work your
way through this backlog of thoughts. Here are a few tips to help you find such a person:

- Your mentor doesn't work in your company

  The less they know about the company, the more fruitful your conversations can be. It
  forces you to explain in the clearest way possible what troubles you. You
  also feel as free as possible to talk about your work.

- You meet with them regularly

  The frequency works a bit like one-on-ones. It depends on how much you need.
  Choose a mentor that knows how much time they can invest into mentoring upfront.

- Your mentor knows the job

  I wouldn't consider this a strict requirement, what matters is that they have
  leadership experience. But it helps if they have experience leading
  developers. Contextual understanding makes discussions about organisational
  structure, project and product management much more productive. The faster you
  can process your thoughts about those, the more you can focus on people.

You know that your relationship with your mentor works when their questions challenge
you. You keep thinking about past conversations and look forward to
the next one. If you only take one thing with you from this chapter, let it be this:
find yourself a mentor.
